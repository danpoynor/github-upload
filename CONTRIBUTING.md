# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Use [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) to check for common markdown style inconsistency.

Here’s how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

1. [Fork this project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to your account.
2. [Create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from your fork’s branch to our master branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
