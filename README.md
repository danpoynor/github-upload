# WIP Example Repo Containing Some Special GitHub Files

## Description

A collection of [GitHub](https://github.com) repo files that briefly explains their use.

## Usage

- Read through this READMEs [Files](#files) section to discover each of their uses.
- Investigate the Further Reading links to learn more about each file.
- Copy/paste from the examples as needed.
- If you find this repo interesting star it for future reference.

## Contributing workflow

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Use [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) to check for common markdown style inconsistency.

Here’s how we suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

1. [Fork this project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to your account.
2. [Create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from your fork’s branch to our master branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.

### :page_facing_up: `.gitignore`

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

You can create a .gitignore file in your repository's root directory to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit. To share the ignore rules with other users who clone the repository, commit the .gitignore file in to your repository.

GitHub maintains an official list of recommended .gitignore files for many popular operating systems, environments, and languages in the github/gitignore public repository. You can also use gitignore.io to create a .gitignore file for your operating system, programming language, or IDE. For more information, see "[github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore)" and the "[gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/)" site.

If you want to ignore a file that is already checked in, you must untrack the file before you add a rule to ignore it. From your terminal, untrack the file.

```shell
$ git rm --cached FILENAME
```

[GitHub Docs: Configuring ignored files for all repositories on your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files#configuring-ignored-files-for-all-repositories-on-your-computer)

You can also create a global .gitignore file to define a list of rules for ignoring files in every Git repository on your computer. For example, you might create the file at ~/.gitignore_global and add some rules to it.

Configure Git to use the exclude file ~/.gitignore_global for all Git repositories.

```shell
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

[GitHub Docs: Excluding local files without creating a .gitignore file](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files#excluding-local-files-without-creating-a-gitignore-file)]

If you don't want to create a .gitignore file to share with others, you can create rules that are not committed with the repository. You can use this technique for locally-generated files that you don't expect other users to generate, such as files created by your editor.

Use your favorite text editor to open the file called .git/info/exclude within the root of your Git repository. Any rule you add here will not be checked in, and will only ignore files for your local repository.

1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the location of your Git repository.
3. Using your favorite text editor, open the file *.git/info/exclude*.

### :page_facing_up: `.nojekyll`

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

GitHub Pages will use Jekyll to build your site by default. If you want to use a static site generator other than Jekyll, disable the Jekyll build process by creating an empty file called `.nojekyll` in the root of your publishing source, then follow your static site generator's instructions to build your site locally.

GitHub Pages does not support server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, or Python.

### :page_facing_up: `CODEOWNERS`

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

Repository administrators can define exactly which people and teams need to review projects using the CODEOWNERS file. This feature automatically assigns reviewers based on Code Owners when a pull request changes any owned files, using the same syntax as the .gitignore file.

Use the CODEOWNERS file to ensure that changes to specific areas of the codebase are always reviewed by those with the most expertise.

# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like

# If a member of @example-org/content opens a pull request 
# with a change inside the `/apps` directory, their approval is implicit.
# The team is still added as a reviewer but not a required reviewer.
# Anyone can approve the changes.

### :page_facing_up: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions.

### :page_facing_up: `CONTRIBUTING.md`

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

To help your project contributors do good work, you can add a file with contribution guidelines to your project repository's root, `docs`, or `.github` folder. When someone opens a pull request or creates an issue, they will see a link to that file. The link to the contributing guidelines also appears on your repository's `contribute` page.

For the repository owner, contribution guidelines are a way to communicate how people should contribute.

For contributors, the guidelines help them verify that they're submitting well-formed pull requests and opening useful issues.

For both owners and contributors, contribution guidelines save time and hassle caused by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.
