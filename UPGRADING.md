Upgrading Guide

See the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for information about what has changed between versions.

This guide should be useful to figure out what you need to do between breaking changes.

As always, [submit issues](https://github.com/danpoynor/special-github-files/issues/new) that you run into with this guide or with these upgrades.
